## Back-End Requirements

1. User Management:

   Handles user registration, login, and profile management. It ensures users can securely access the platform as guests or   hosts, and manage their account details.

3. Property Management:

    Allows hosts to list, update, and remove properties. This feature is key to building the marketplace by letting users share available spaces for rent.

4. Booking System:

    Enables guests to view property availability and make reservations. It manages booking dates and ensures properties canâ€™t be double-booked.

5. Review System:

    Lets guests leave ratings and comments after staying at a property. This helps improve trust and decision-making for future users.

5. Payment Processing:

    Handles the payment for bookings. It ensures secure and accurate transactions between guests and hosts.

6. Authentication and Authorization:

    Protects user data and actions through secure login and role-based access. Only authorized users can perform certain actions (e.g., only hosts can list properties).

7. API Access (REST & GraphQL):

    Provides endpoints for interacting with the system programmatically. This supports integration with frontend apps or external services.

8. CI/CD Integration:

    Uses GitHub Actions and Docker for testing and deployment automation. This ensures updates are safely and efficiently pushed to production.
